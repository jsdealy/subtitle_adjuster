1
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,999
I REMEMBER

2
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,158
The puffballs!

3
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,111
“When the puffballs come,
then winter is almost gone.”

4
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,313
“When the puffballs soar,
then winter is no more.”

5
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,751
I've got the best one!

6
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,833
- Ciccio, let's go to the seashore.
- Look at this one!

7
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,835
In our town, the puffballs
arrive hand in hand with spring.

8
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:19,078
These are the sort of puffballs
that drift around,

9
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,719
<i>soaring over the cemetery,
where all rest in peace,</i>

10
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,554
<i>soaring over the beachfront
and the Germans, newly arrived,</i>

11
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,791
<i>who don't feel the cold.</i>

12
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,590
<i>Drifting, drifting...</i>

13
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,154
<i>swirling...</i>

14
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,318
<i>swirling... swirling...</i>

15
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,953
<i>Drifting, drifting, drifting!</i>

16
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,873
I'm the last of fourteen children.

17
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:51,353
By then my father had had enough,
so he called me Definitivo.

18
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:55,718
If he'd had enough sooner,
there'd have been one less chatterer.

19
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,314
Good evening.

20
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,232
See you in the square.

21
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,230
I've come for my sister.
Am I too early?

22
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,078
Your sister's here.

23
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,834
Fiorella, I'm all done.
Come in.

24
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,635
<i>Ibetter calm you down,
you horny beast. What a body!</i>

25
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,754
The bonfire's bigger
this year than last.

26
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,714
You going to the bonfire tonight?
What are you playing?

27
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,911
A brand-new tune I wrote.

28
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,717
Listen to this.

29
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,792
Now, Dad, we'll watch them
light the bonfire, then off to bed.

30
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,270
The doctor says
you must get to bed early.

31
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,319
The doctor's an asshole.
I'll go to bed when I want.

32
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,876
Then you'll end up in the hospital,
and this time <i>I'll</i> leave you there.

33
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:01,472
Blackheads! Numskulls!

34
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,709
Scram! That's my spot!

35
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,309
Creeps!

36
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:20,155
- Let me through!
- Listen to this one.

37
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,391
One father can take care
of 100 kids,

38
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,150
but 100 kids can't take care
of one father. That's the gospel truth.

39
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,957
- I want to set off a firecracker.
- Stay here!

40
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,592
Hey, Giudizio, catch!

41
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,915
I can, I command, I want!
Long live Giudizio!

42
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,756
Volpina,
have you made love today?

43
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,310
How many men did you service?

44
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,510
I bet you even dip a cock
in your morning coffee.

45
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,154
Here she is!

46
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,199
You're the greatest, Gradisca.
Greta Garbo's got nothing on you!

47
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,029
Let's go over there.

48
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,550
Ronald Colman, we're over here!

49
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,078
Giudizio, take this chair too.

50
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,638
Burn this one too.
Put it on top.

51
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,037
Set the old witch in it.

52
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,958
<i>I'll</i> stuff that chair down your throat!
Take it back home!

53
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,439
The old witch!

54
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,950
The old witch is here!

55
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,760
Let me marry her
before you burn her!

56
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,990
What are you looking at?

57
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,549
I wasn't looking, I swear.

58
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,119
Lay off!

59
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,913
Don't look.
You'll get too excited.

60
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,237
Bring the firecrackers!

61
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,950
Light the bonfire
and burn the old witch!

62
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:52,271
“Burn away, O witch so old.
Burn the winter and the cold.”

63
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,193
Here comes spring!

64
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,791
- I don't have a match.
- But your beloved has, my dear.

65
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,913
Long live the old witch!

66
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,879
Long live Giudizio!

67
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,760
I can, I command, I want!

68
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,518
Where's the ladder?

69
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,520
You want it? Take it!

70
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,112
Take it!

71
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,874
Hurry! I'm burning up!

72
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,199
In America I saw bonfires
300 feet high.

73
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,512
- When were you ever in America?
- My parents are American.

74
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,353
I'll break your neck!

75
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,909
You should hear what my father
can do with his ass!

76
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,316
Hurray for spring!

77
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,477
- It gives me a funny feeling.
- Yeah, me too.

78
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,792
But winter's dying
and spring is on its way.

79
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,952
I feel it all over me already!

80
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,519
Our respects, milord.
Our respects, ma'am.

81
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,557
Our respects to you,
little countess.

82
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,391
Drink a little.
It'll do you good.

83
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,154
Look, even your aunt's drinking.

84
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,796
Good old Lallo!
No one would know you're 60.

85
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:45,633
Look at that.
Your brother really is an asshole.

86
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,313
He's just a kid.

87
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,629
Now watch
the Malaysian tiger leap!

88
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,350
Watch it!

89
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,599
You'll catch it
when we get home!

90
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,633
- The heel came off.
- Then he'll have to do without one!

91
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,638
Where's that other
useless ass gone?

92
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,276
Ciccio, throw the big bang
on the fire!

93
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,796
What are you up to?
Off to bed with you!

94
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,832
<i>I'll</i> put you
in boarding school!

95
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:25,434
It's Scureza di Corpolb, “The Fart.”
Go to it, Scureza!

96
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,316
Bravo, Scureza!

97
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,034
The origins of this town
are lost in the mists of time.

98
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,950
In the municipal museum,
there are stone implements...

99
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,714
- All the best.
- My respects.

100
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,791
That date to prehistoric times.

101
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,391
I myself have found
some graffiti of great antiquity

102
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,120
in caves
on Count Lovignano's estate.

103
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,349
Be that as it may, the first date
we know for certain is 268 BC,

104
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:19,878
when this became a Roman colony
and the start of the Emilian Way.

105
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,753
<i>[MI'. Lawyef]</i>

106
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:30,519
That, too, is characteristic
of the irreverent nature of these people,

107
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,752
who bear Roman and Celtic blood
in their veins.

108
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,118
Theirs is an exuberant,
generous, tenacious nature.

109
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:42,160
The divine Dante,
Pascoli, D'Annunzio

110
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,593
and many others
have lauded this land,

111
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:50,594
and innumerable are its sons
who have contributed greatly

112
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:54,390
to art, science,
religion and politics.

113
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,190
Who is that?

114
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,519
You think you're funny,

115
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,194
but you're too cowardly
to show your face.

116
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,474
Show yourself.

117
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,429
Come out here
and <i>I'll</i> teach you a thing or two!

118
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,959
- Mr. <i>Lawyer.</i>
- Yeah, yeah.

119
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,953
<i>Gentlemen!</i>

120
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,960
What's all this?

121
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:46,033
- Shall we take our places?
- If you insist, headmaster.

122
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,953
But I never come out well
in pictures.

123
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,639
You boys in the back,
get up on the bench.

124
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,910
- What is it now, De Santis?
- It wasn't me, sir!

125
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,510
Aldina.

126
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,597
Look - it looks like you.

127
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,919
What's going on?

128
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,718
Gigliozzi!

129
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,520
Take your seat.

130
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,472
Put it down her back.

131
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,756
Hold it like that, please.

132
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,393
<i>What is this?</i>

133
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,880
A stone.

134
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,350
- Yes, but what is it?
- <i>Lknow.</i>

135
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,239
It's for a slingshot.
An elephant's testicle?

136
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,392
<i>I'll</i> tell you. It's a pendulum.

137
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:57,554
You've certainly all seen
a grandfather clock.

138
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,119
And how does it go?

139
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:16,554
Where did Tiberius retire to
upon giving up command of the empire?

140
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,395
<i>Capri.</i>

141
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:31,436
- When was Agrippina killed?
- 69 AD.

142
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:36,599
Why did you give me a zero?
Wasn't it 69?

143
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,757
It was 59 AD.

144
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,234
Are you sure?

145
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,756
What do you mean, am I sure?
It was 59 AD!

146
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,837
Damn it! I knew it!

147
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,799
You'll drive me crazy!
Get back to your seat!

148
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,110
Why couldn't it have been 69?

149
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:01,353
<i>There will come a day</i>

150
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,437
when a renewed Italy

151
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,591
will take to the field of battle
on her own behalf

152
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,111
and not to defend her soil for others,
with their weapons.

153
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:13,837
Being spirit, the Universal
becomes incarnate in the state

154
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,516
and cannot but enter
into the true nature of the church.

155
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:23,314
But this reconciliation between church
and state came about through a deity

156
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:28,031
who brought order
to members of church and state,

157
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,192
demanding iron discipline
and the right to intervene

158
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,073
in every aspect of individual life.

159
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,480
He is God's chosen son

160
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:39,593
because he has
the same power as the Father.

161
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:43,799
Then there is the Holy Spirit,
to be placed on the same level

162
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,839
as the Father and the Son.
Is that clear?

163
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,913
That is why God is one
and also a trinity.

164
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,756
Today we'll speak
of the great Giotto.

165
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,672
Whose balls exploded like this!

166
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,275
Do you know, boys and girls,

167
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:04,673
why Giotto is so important
in Italian painting?

168
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,836
<i>I'll</i> tell you:
Because he invented perspective.

169
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,200
Per-spec-tive!

170
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,674
Teacher, may I leave the room?
Bobo let a real stinker!

171
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,635
What's that?

172
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,072
You're crazy.

173
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,273
It's not true. I never fart.

174
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,391
- You do too.
- I do not.

175
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,710
Alboino...

176
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,233
signed the peace.

177
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,837
Gigliozzi, out!

178
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,914
This one isn't difficult.
Solve it.

179
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,599
Why did you stop?
You were doing fine.

180
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,398
What were you trying to do?

181
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,352
- Give me a clue.
- Pass it here.

182
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,870
Just think a moment.

183
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:11,237
X9 plus the square root of K3.

184
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,550
It's obvious!

185
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,954
Move over.
What have you done here?

186
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,398
We'll go through it together.
What's this here?

187
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:31,112
What's this here, I said.
You must know how to read.

188
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,590
- But I -
- Keep quiet!

189
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,234
X9 plus the square root of K3...

190
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,630
There's your answer.

191
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,839
X1 = 140.

192
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,675
X2 = 3/5ths of the total,
less the difference.

193
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,319
Is that clear?

194
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,159
What have you done?

195
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,152
Are you crazy?

196
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,789
Janitor!

197
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,434
- Greek is so beautiful, isn't it?
- You betcha.

198
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,154
It's so musical.

199
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,553
<i>Emarpszamen.</i> Repeat after <i>me.</i>

200
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,836
Quiet.

201
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,600
Quiet down, the rest of you.
Try it again.

202
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,115
- Teacher, could you be so kind -
- As to what?

203
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,271
Could I hear it again?

204
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,871
Certainly. Listen.

205
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,592
Careful with the tongue.

206
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:58,038
It has to go here,
against the palate.

207
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,350
Then spit it out.

208
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,359
Quiet.

209
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,872
Try once more.

210
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,678
You see? Greek is so difficult.

211
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,990
What did you do
with your tongue?

212
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,718
Don't stick it out so far.

213
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:34,073
- Like this?
- That's right.

214
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:43,075
- Back to your seat, damn it!
- I nearly had it that time.

215
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:48,439
- <i>Whois that?</i>
- <i>It's Ciccio.</i>

216
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,871
- Let me have that.
- Just one drag, okay?

217
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:58,110
Is it true Aldina tore up
yet another of your poems?

218
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,918
Yeah, but I've got another one.

219
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:04,631
“What a kind, gentle maiden
thou art, Aldina.

220
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:09,590
You set my heart beating
like a steam hammer.”

221
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:15,519
- it's so nice and warm outside.
- I prefer Aldina's mother.

222
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,557
I wonder who's down
on the beach this morning.

223
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,636
Fu Manchu!

224
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,558
<i>Volpina!</i>

225
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,634
Volpina, come here!

226
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,911
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

227
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,315
<i>What do you want?</i>

228
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,834
I lost my pussycat.

229
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,189
Really?

230
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,597
There are no cats around here.

231
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,319
Go on home now.

232
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,797
It's hot, isn't it?

233
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,000
Aren't you all hot?

234
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,950
She's an odd one, eh?

235
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,037
Be a good girl and run on home.

236
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,560
There are no cats here.

237
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,589
<i>Hey, boss!</i>

238
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,434
Mortar wrote another poem.

239
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,796
When do you manage
to write these poems?

240
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,197
Mortar, let the boss
hear your poem.

241
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,513
Let's hear it.

242
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,553
What's it called?

243
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,956
- “Bricks.”
- Good title.

244
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,873
“My grandfather made bricks.

245
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,350
My father made bricks.

246
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:02,712
I make bricks too,

247
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,712
but where's my house?”.

248
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,754
Very true. I get your point.

249
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:15,231
Quite right.
But I, too, was once a poor man,

250
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,153
and I gradually worked
my way up to master builder.

251
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:21,352
Things don't just fall in your lap.

252
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,751
You have to be patient.
You have to work.

253
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,316
With hard work, you can do it.
You have to work.

254
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,312
Aren't we working?

255
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,549
That's enough!

256
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,594
No drinking before the soup.

257
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,479
Not before the soup.
Is that engraved somewhere?

258
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,029
Your stomach will swell up.
I read it in the paper.

259
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:50,515
- Keep your hands to yourself!
- There's a spoon missing.

260
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,351
- Is it hot, Lallino?
- A little.

261
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:59,794
- Gimme a lot!
- You'll get your share.

262
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,953
Would you like some more, Lallo?
There's a little left.

263
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,597
- Has it got enough salt?
- Yes, Grandpa.

264
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,713
Gina, give Grandpa a little.
He's already eaten.

265
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:19,914
My father's father
was known as “Big Meat.”

266
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,959
He lived to be 107
and he was still doing it!

267
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,637
I can't take anymore.

268
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,513
So?

269
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:36,958
So when I was little, he taught me
to eat at 11:00 in the morning,

270
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,755
before the sun burns your head,

271
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,558
and at 4:00 in the afternoon.

272
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,599
Otherwise food is like poison

273
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,478
that gets into your blood.

274
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,389
Aren't you eating?

275
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,439
What did you do to your mother?

276
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,159
Nothing.

277
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,273
It's nothing <i>they</i> did!

278
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,999
Damn it all!

279
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:04,313
I get up at 4:00 a.m.
and slave away all day like a mule,

280
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:09,754
and when I come home for a crust
of bread, I find a bunch of long faces!

281
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,989
Now you won't have
to look at this one!

282
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:20,076
Ma'am, it's time
to take the water off the stove.

283
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,640
- What's the matter?
- Nothing!

284
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,950
- Then eat something!
- I don't want anything!

285
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,839
- Why not?
- Because I don't!

286
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:34,313
- Shut the door. It's cold.
- Just a minute.

287
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,756
I'm still convalescing.

288
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,753
- Who can that be at this hour?
- How would I know!

289
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,514
- Shall I go?
- Yes.

290
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,950
You think my fanny's
a good-luck charm?

291
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,158
Chicken always gets stuck
in my teeth.

292
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,630
Okay if I take a little more, Dad?

293
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,710
Hands off!

294
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,235
- Just a wing.
- <i>I'll</i> do the serving here.

295
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,677
Tell me, Miranda:
Did you put mint in this?

296
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,435
What do you mean, mint?
It's sage.

297
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,309
But you noticed something
was different, didn't you?

298
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,869
Lallino has a sensitive palate.

299
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,077
Gina! Who is it?

300
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,593
- Well?
- It's Mr. Biondi.

301
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,276
- Right when I'm eating!
- Isn't he the bishop's cousin?

302
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,551
Are you bottomless pits
or what?

303
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,836
Anyone would think
I never fed you!

304
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:37,791
- Uncle, watch.
- If your dad sees you!

305
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,713
Uncle, do that trick for us.

306
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,110
Come on, just once.

307
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,877
Look, Titta!

308
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,270
Bravo!

309
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,353
- Isn't that hard, Uncle?
- Well, you know...

310
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,358
Good wine, this Sangiovese.

311
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,517
By the way,
where were you last night?

312
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:15,877
Me? At the movies.

313
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,713
And what was showing?

314
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:23,758
The Americans were trying
to penetrate Comanche territory.

315
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,877
They built a bridge for the rail road,

316
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:31,075
but the Indians shot arrows at them.
It was a massacre!

317
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,277
I'll massacre you,
you little hooligan!

318
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,113
What's going on?

319
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:39,109
- I didn't do anything!
- Aurelio, leave him alone!

320
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,833
<i>I'll</i> put you in the hospital!

321
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,152
People are watching.

322
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:51,270
Starting tomorrow, no more school,
no more allowance!

323
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,471
He can start working with me!

324
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:57,634
- And how will you pay me?
- With a hammer in the face!

325
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:01,111
You have to tell me
who fathered this piece of shit!

326
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:04,836
At his age, I'd already
been working for three years!

327
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,674
Right, and you gave
all your money to Grandma!

328
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,719
That's enough now!
Come in and eat!

329
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,791
Hello.

330
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,318
Everyone in town laughs at us,
even the roosters.

331
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:24,870
- In my own home, I'll do as I please!
- Listen to His Royal Highness!

332
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,757
Give me your brother's plate.

333
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:34,030
- Where are you going with that?
- What did he do?

334
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,158
What did he do?
<i>I'll</i> show you what he did!

335
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,431
What did he do?

336
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:45,237
What did your brother do? Speak up!
I don't know!

337
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:48,950
This is Mr. Biondi's hat.
He was at the movies last night.

338
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:52,391
Just smell it.
Know who did that?

339
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,710
That delinquent son of yours.

340
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:58,436
He pissed over the balcony rail,
right on Biondi's head.

341
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,477
It cost me three bills!

342
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,758
I'm sure it was those juvenile
delinquents he hangs around with!

343
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,309
Enough!

344
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,155
Stop taking his side!
He's getting worse and worse!

345
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:15,030
They're a pair of little hoodlums!
You've brought them up wrong!

346
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,990
Then you do it!
Let's see how well you do!

347
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:23,312
I can't stand any more!
I'm going crazy!

348
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,915
I'm going mad!

349
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,277
<i>I'll</i> kill the whole lot of you!

350
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:36,518
I'll put strychnine in your soup!

351
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:39,433
<i>That's what I'll do!</i>

352
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,398
One, two, three...

353
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:54,239
- But I'll kill myself first!
- Good.

354
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,518
- Right now!
- Go ahead.

355
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:01,838
You'll see!
I'll kill myself first!

356
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,396
Uncle, look at Dad!

357
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,993
Why do these things happen to me?
What have I done?

358
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,995
Goddamn it all!

359
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,312
- Did you hurt yourself?
- What are you doing on the floor?

360
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:56,233
- Hey, man, avoid this one if you can.
- Not the hat!

361
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,193
Evening, headmaster.

362
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,274
- There's Gradisca!
- Where?

363
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,836
If you give the archbishop permission
to sell holy pictures in the schools,

364
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:32,199
I'm sure there'll be no need to -

365
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,834
When are you showing
The <i>Vale</i> of <i>Love</i> with Gary Cooper?

366
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,037
Next week, my dear.

367
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,395
Thank you.

368
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:54,393
When can your little prince
come to bed with you?

369
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:58,116
You'll get my purse
over your head!

370
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,111
Such behavior!

371
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,438
Get lost, Giudizio.

372
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,035
It was beautiful!
I had a good cry!

373
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:12,080
Romanesque, 13th century,
perfectly preserved.

374
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:20,551
Mullion windows.
Excuse me. <i>I'll</i> continue later.

375
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:25,756
Lallo, read the telegram
“White Feather” got from Stockholm.

376
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:30,034
“Come immediately.
Cannot live without you. Inge.”

377
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,272
Is she the bucktoothed one
from last summer?

378
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,274
Are you going?
It'll be damned cold up there now!

379
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:45,797
If I shot them,
they'd call me a murderer.

380
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,869
<i>I'll</i> throw them all
in a pit of lime!

381
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,077
Get the hell out of here!

382
00:32:56,280 --> 00:33:00,638
I couldn't leave Mamma behind
for those buck teeth.

383
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,235
Look at Madam's new girls.

384
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,439
Hey, look!

385
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,956
See the big one with the hood?

386
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,878
Here I am!

387
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,674
Me too!

388
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,992
It's my God-given right to -

389
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:40,876
A lovely man.
A lot like Wallace Beery.

390
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,833
With that beard,
he looked like a French duke.

391
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,316
That's some cargo!

392
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,879
Good night, King Vittorio.
Good night, everybody.

393
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,031
<i>This is the Victory Monument.</i>

394
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,311
<i>We used to visit it every day.</i>

395
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,232
<i>And I dreamed about it
at night too.</i>

396
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,030
- I'm going, Mamma.
- Make a good confession.

397
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,874
If you've had anything to drink,
you can't receive communion.

398
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:24,072
<i>You can drink water.
You just can't eat anything.</i>

399
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,953
Not even water.

400
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,276
And tell him
that you're a delinquent,

401
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,474
that you upset your mother and father,
and that you answer back.

402
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:36,312
And that you curse everything,
understand?

403
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,470
Everything!

404
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,755
Who's first?

405
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,998
- How long since your last confession?
- Christmas.

406
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:06,233
My God! Mass on days of obligation?
Except when I had the mumps.

407
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,597
- Do you honor your father and mother?
- Yes.

408
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,512
No, not like that!

409
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:15,634
White on one side, yellow on the other.
What's it matter?

410
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:19,270
- It's a question of aesthetics.
- Fine.

411
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,670
Now then, do you honor
your father and mother?

412
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,153
Yes, but they don't honor me.
They beat me.

413
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:31,638
- You must annoy them. Do you tell lies?
- I have to.

414
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,518
Do you covet others' goods?

415
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:36,519
The small flowers
go in the small vases.

416
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,317
What did you say you covet?

417
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:42,996
My pal Bragger's got a raincoat
with metal buckles

418
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,716
like the detective's
in the William Powell-Myrna Loy films.

419
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,995
Do you commit impure acts?
Do you touch yourself?

420
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,551
Do you know St. Louis weeps
when you touch yourself?

421
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,118
<i>Let him weep.</i>

422
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:02,517
<i>I'm not gonna tell you.
You'll only tell Dad.</i>

423
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,515
<i>Don't tell me
you don't touch yourself.</i>

424
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,957
<i>How can you not, when you see
the woman in the tobacco shop,</i>

425
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:12,232
<i>as stacked as she is,
and she says...</i>

426
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:15,160
Export brand?

427
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,912
<i>And the math teacher
who looks just like a lion?</i>

428
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,918
<i>Mother of God!</i>

429
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:26,154
<i>How can you not touch yourself
when she looks at you that way?</i>

430
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:31,198
<i>What do you think we come
to see on St. Anthony's day,</i>

431
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,074
<i>when they bless the animals?
The sheep's butts?</i>

432
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,236
<i>See how he's looking at me?</i>

433
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,676
<i>How can I tell him about Volpina</i>

434
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:05,191
<i>and the time
I pumped up her tires?</i>

435
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,872
I didn't know people kissed like that.
Did you?

436
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,792
With their tongues
going in and out?

437
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,071
I'll ask the questions here.

438
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,310
Go on.

439
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,193
<i>Then there's Gradisca.</i>

440
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:23,712
<i>Last summer I saw her going
into the movie theater.</i>

441
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,800
<i>It's not - You see -</i>

442
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,600
I <i>'m crazy about Grad/Sea.</i>

443
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,433
<i>I want a wife just like her.</i>

444
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,080
<i>She was alone.</i>

445
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,516
<i>There, right before my eyes.</i>

446
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,073
<i>I changed seats.</i>

447
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,593
<i>I changed seats again...</i>

448
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,154
<i>and again.</i>

449
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,513
<i>And finally...</i>

450
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,319
Looking for something?

451
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,876
<i>I sat there like an asshole.</i>

452
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,872
<i>I could have jumped
in the harbor.</i>

453
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,559
<i>Father Balosa
can't understand these things.</i>

454
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:46,155
<i>But since I had to say something,</i>

455
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,711
<i>I said I'd touched myself once,
just a little,</i>

456
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,031
<i>but that I regretted it
immediately.</i>

457
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,871
<i>He was happy with that.</i>

458
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:58,710
<i>I had to say three Our Fathers,
Hail Marys and Glorias, and that was it.</i>

459
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:03,238
You're absolved. Three Our Fathers,
Hail Marys and Glorias.

460
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,992
Do you touch yourself?

461
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,197
Just look at those rings
under your eyes.

462
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,636
You obviously do.

463
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,552
Just once.

464
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,358
<i>In the garage.</i>

465
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,717
- Quit it!
- What?

466
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,558
Always touching me.

467
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:32,473
- Jean Harlow!
- Gradisca!

468
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,876
The tobacco lady's tits!

469
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,798
- The girl at the circus!
- Which one?

470
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,031
With the fishnet stockings.

471
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,470
Aldina!

472
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,029
No, Aldina's mine!
I'll smack your face!

473
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,793
Platoon, attention!

474
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,599
There he is!

475
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,398
Comrades!

476
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,879
<i>Hail</i> // <i>Duce!</i>

477
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:22,071
We hail I/Duce with grateful hearts
and the Fascist salute!

478
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:27,351
The greeting of Imperial Rome

479
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,634
that shows us...

480
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,113
the path of destiny
that Fascist Italy must follow.

481
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:56,320
Let me touch him!
I want to touch him!

482
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,552
Long live // <i>Duce/.</i>

483
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:28,309
Ninety-nine per cent
of the population are party members.

484
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,792
We have 1,200 Young Fascist boys
and 3,000 Young Fascist girls.

485
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,593
Our Fascist hearts beat as one,

486
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:37,593
but the work
on the maritime front needs attention.

487
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:43,273
This marvelous enthusiasm makes us
young and yet so old at the same time.

488
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:47,031
Young, because Fascism
has rejuvenated our blood

489
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:49,470
with glowing ideals
from ancient times.

490
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:54,271
All I can say is
Mussolini's got two balls this big!

491
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:00,555
Today, April 21st, we celebrate
the birth of Rome, the Eternal City.

492
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:04,594
What does that mean?
That we must respect the monuments,

493
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,838
the ruins that Rome has left us,

494
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:12,074
which is what I've done all along,
despite being razzed at night.

495
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:27,434
Do we not see,
on this glorious, sun-filled day,

496
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:31,037
that the Italian sun,
forever free,

497
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,760
is a divine sign
that the heavens are on our side?

498
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:35,874
Miranda.

499
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,517
- Who locked the gate?
- I did.

500
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,114
- Why?
- You know why.

501
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:44,833
Unlock it.

502
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,277
You've heard what's been going on
in the piazza all day.

503
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:51,796
Open up. I have business to take care of.
Nothing doing.

504
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,514
You're staying at home.
What's all this stuff?

505
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:56,637
If I wanted to be a widow,
I'd kill you myself.

506
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,360
I'll strangle you
with your neckerchief!

507
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,831
Think I'm scared
of those black-shirted lice?

508
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,078
Give me the key.

509
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:09,634
Damn it all!

510
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:15,751
Why is it that
whenever there's a rally,

511
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:18,839
I have to stay home?
This is the last straw!

512
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:23,029
One, two, three, four...

513
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,472
These youth are sturdy as rock.

514
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,236
Yes, sturdy as rock.

515
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,391
One, two...

516
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:55,880
<i>Hail</i> // <i>Duce!</i>

517
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:15,076
<i>Young Fascist Ciccio Marconi,</i>

518
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:20,997
<i>do you wish to marry
Young Fascist Aldina Cordini?</i>

519
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:25,556
And you,
Young Fascist Aldina Cordini,

520
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:30,869
do you wish to marry
Young Fascist Ciccio Marconi?

521
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:32,640
Bravo, Ciccio!

522
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,958
Comrades, they speak
of “bread and work,”

523
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:58,118
but wouldn't
“bread and wine” be better?

524
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,798
- Fernet.
- Coffee.

525
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,314
Just a soft drink.

526
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:15,152
Three cheers for our comrade!

527
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:26,558
- Difficult shot.
- Yes, Your Excellency.

528
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:29,678
- Difficult shot.
- Indeed, Your Excellency.

529
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:44,556
I wouldn't like
to go up against him.

530
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:56,272
- Who killed the lights?
- Attilio, light a candle.

531
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:57,555
Light a candle!

532
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:04,758
There's a phonograph up above.

533
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:06,558
What are you saying?

534
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,039
Silence!

535
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:14,392
- That's the “Internationale”!
- What's that?

536
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:15,914
The anthem of subversives.

537
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:17,833
Where's it coming from?

538
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:19,713
Where are you hiding,
you scoundrel?

539
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:21,760
Incredible!

540
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:27,313
Show yourself, coward!

541
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:32,878
We await your orders, sir!

542
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:37,400
Everyone is to go home!

543
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:41,038
And close your windows!

544
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:46,077
Get inside, you!

545
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,197
Go home!

546
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:54,195
What are you doing there?
Go home!

547
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:13,760
Hey! He's up there!

548
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:16,991
Come home now!

549
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:19,436
Up in the bell tower!

550
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:02,393
<i>To arms.</i>

551
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:06,639
<i>We are Fascists
We fight the Communists.</i>

552
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:17,277
GOD - COUNTRY - FAMILY

553
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,032
<i>You're free to go.</i>

554
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,952
You can go home.

555
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:44,351
You see?
We Fascists aren't all that bad.

556
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:48,953
We didn't harm
a single hair on your head.

557
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,192
More like a cozy little
kaffeeklatsch.

558
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,472
Good night, sonny boy.

559
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:59,073
Bring him here.

560
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,193
Take off your hat.

561
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:19,274
Sorry, it's a habit.
Even at home.

562
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:22,237
Why don't you give
the Roman salute?

563
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:26,515
I didn't know it was mandatory.

564
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:28,990
I know nothing about politics.

565
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:31,119
Sit down.

566
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,470
So you know nothing
about politics.

567
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:38,074
Yet you've been heard to say,

568
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:42,914
“If Mussolini keeps on like this,
I really don't know.”

569
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:47,430
What did you mean by
“I really don't know”?

570
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,429
I never said anything like that.

571
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:55,116
I generally only talk about my work.
Perhaps I said,

572
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:58,910
“I really don't know
how politics work.

573
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:00,793
Was it a threat?

574
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,315
Certainly not.

575
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:05,598
- Lack of faith in Fascism?
- No. Why?

576
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:10,314
- Or perhaps subversive propaganda?
- No, I'd have no reason.

577
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:16,758
And you know nothing
about the phonograph either?

578
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:19,870
Phonograph?

579
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:22,236
Don't get smart! Answer!

580
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:26,759
I was asleep.
These guys woke me up.

581
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:29,514
I didn't even have time
to put on my tie.

582
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:35,075
Your tie...
or your anarchist's neckerchief?

583
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:38,158
What neckerchief?

584
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:46,834
Would you like to drink a toast
to the triumph of Fascism?

585
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,357
Really, at this hour -

586
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:53,437
At this hour!

587
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:59,594
You fools!
Trying our patience like this!

588
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:03,993
You must drink
to a Fascist victory, my friend.

589
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:07,033
Don't make us crack
your skulls open to convince you

590
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:09,959
that Fascism is
for your protection and dignity!

591
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:13,278
To hell with you
ignorant bunch of animals!

592
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:20,195
- This is castor oil.
- Drink it.

593
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:24,758
No. Why should <i>w</i> What did <i>I</i> do?

594
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:30,431
What are you doing? Let me go!

595
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:36,637
Be a good boy, now.
Open your mouth.

596
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:38,797
Don't make me angry.

597
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:41,994
Drink up. It'll do you good.

598
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:45,592
Just look at him,
a man of his age.

599
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,239
He's a disgrace!

600
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:50,590
You vomiting on my shoes?

601
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:54,399
This is what saddens us.

602
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:58,552
This utter refusal to understand.

603
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:00,159
Why?

604
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:02,676
Why?

605
00:54:03,455 --> 00:54:05,215
There must be something wrong
with your head.

606
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:09,279
Have some more.
It'll clear up those ideas of yours.

607
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:12,910
- You'll pay for this.
- Send us the bill.

608
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:16,432
Good heavens, 2:00 o'clock.

609
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,472
What happened?

610
00:54:56,920 --> 00:55:00,276
You won't listen to me.

611
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:03,753
You'll see.

612
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:13,719
Stand up.

613
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:19,678
Dry yourself off.

614
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,319
Don't catch cold.

615
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:31,990
Dad!

616
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:35,393
Go to bed!

617
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:37,831
God, he stinks!

618
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:45,678
If the person who squealed
is who I think it was,

619
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:48,673
he'd better move
to another continent

620
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:51,434
<i>or I'll eat his guts out!</i>

621
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:53,432
<i>I'll</i> have his balls for dinner!

622
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:56,675
Traitorous son of a bitch!

623
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:04,039
<i>The Grand Hotel.</i>

624
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:07,438
<i>I call her “the Old Lady.”</i>

625
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:12,511
I come here every year
to sip the nectar of love.

626
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:16,156
I offer tenderness
and yearn for tenderness in return.

627
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:19,233
I'm the only one in town
who visits the Grand Hotel.

628
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:21,517
They say Gradisca was here once,

629
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:25,554
and it was because of
that highly improbable adventure

630
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:28,718
that she came
to be called Gradisca.

631
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:32,192
Her real name is Ninola.

632
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:34,192
<i>But one winter night
three years ago...</i>

633
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,710
Don't let us down, Ninola.

634
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:38,797
The prince is a handsome man.

635
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:44,155
If he looks satisfied,
mention the work on the harbor.

636
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:46,755
One word from him
is all it would take.

637
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:49,554
Be polite.
Speak proper Italian.

638
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:52,559
He's a real prince,
not just any old asshole.

639
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:55,673
Besides, it's a great opportunity
for you too.

640
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:57,069
The harbor.

641
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:21,552
Mr. Prince, sir...

642
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:25,318
grad/sea! (Whatever you desire)

643
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:30,073
<i>And that's how Ninola
came to be called Gradisca.</i>

644
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:32,800
Mind you, I don't attribute
much truth to that story,

645
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:35,873
nor to the one
that Biscein tells.

646
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:39,920
He's a born liar.
He makes up a new one every day.

647
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:42,469
A couple of years back,

648
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:46,110
an emir arrived
with his 3O concubines.

649
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:47,953
<i>I saw him arrive.</i>

650
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:40,273
The emir locked all 3O rooms
up tight every night. That much is true.

651
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:44,553
It's the rest of Biscein's story
that leaks like a sieve.

652
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:51,157
<i>The silly man claims
that on that very night...</i>

653
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:55,109
Beans, olives,
toasted melon seeds!

654
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:20,316
I'm coming, girls!

655
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:26,595
Come on, Biscein.

656
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:36,510
Sweet Jesus, the pussy!

657
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:32,032
One, two, three, four...

658
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:36,438
<i>He claims that, between
the beautiful girls and the ugly ones,</i>

659
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:38,671
<i>he polished off
28 of them that night.</i>

660
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:46,519
Uncle!

661
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:54,398
Are you Polish? Only Polish women
have that fire in their eyes.

662
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:58,393
Uncle's a great dancer.

663
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:14,909
Commandant... ladies...

664
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:18,757
Then you must be Czech,

665
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:21,753
because only Czech women
have that fire in their eyes.

666
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:25,117
<i>I know Italian:
Be/I/ssi/no, buona sera,</i>

667
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:27,271
<i>Michelangelo, fanculo,</i>

668
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:28,959
<i>o sole mio.</i>

669
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:48,239
Good evening.

670
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:08,039
- Uncle!
- Get out of here!

671
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:10,760
Jesus, the asshole waiter!

672
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:33,471
You see sea?

673
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:37,152
You take walk with me. Come.

674
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:46,154
Leopardi wrote poetry.
Do you know Leopardi?

675
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:49,479
No, this is my first time here.

676
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:53,078
Dante Alighieri here.

677
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:54,874
Leopardi here,

678
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:56,832
or even here.

679
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,513
Oh, good!

680
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:19,240
How did it go?

681
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:20,879
How do you think?

682
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:23,919
I always find German women
to be pushovers.

683
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:26,717
She's really fallen for me.

684
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:32,039
And to prove it, she even
offered me posterior intimacy.

685
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:57,751
Uncle!

686
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:01,156
<i>Uncle Teo was Dad's brother.</i>

687
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:04,757
<i>We took him out for a ride
once a month in the summer.</i>

688
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:06,639
He's coming.

689
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,718
Here he comes.

690
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:22,319
Hello, Uncle.

691
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:25,153
How are things, Teo?

692
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:26,799
He's happy, Mamma.

693
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:31,193
- He's looking well.
- Yes, he is.

694
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:34,714
Watch your step.

695
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:37,871
- Here he is.
- Hello, Uncle.

696
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:41,236
- How are you?
- And how are you?

697
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:42,959
I'm fine. I go to school.

698
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:50,237
We're taking you
to the farm for some passatel/I.

699
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:53,112
What do you think of that?

700
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:56,109
Look, Dad's here too.

701
01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:59,880
My boy! Give Dad a kiss.

702
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:03,437
- He's doing well.
- He's doing okay.

703
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:06,953
He's grown, hasn't he?
He's in the fifth grade.

704
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:11,154
And that one got dead drunk
the other night.

705
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:14,359
- Teo, how are things?
- I'm much better.

706
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:17,117
Mamma, the pastries.

707
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:20,477
Uncle, Mamma brought you
some pastries.

708
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:22,917
We'll be back before evening.

709
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:25,998
Here, have a smoke on me.

710
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:28,991
Sit here next to Dad.

711
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:34,876
Is Father Pazzaglia still alive?

712
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:37,470
He's been dead ten years now.

713
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:39,870
He's been gone quite some time.

714
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:43,237
- He was alive last year.
- That was Father Amedeo.

715
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:46,353
Is he dead too?

716
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:48,474
No, he's alive.

717
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:51,151
Exactly.
That's what I was saying.

718
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:56,271
I saw him last year,
walking along with a bunch of flowers.

719
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:59,034
I wonder where he was going.

720
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:05,113
Teo was a bright lad
when he was eight.

721
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:08,716
No offense, Aurelio,

722
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:13,511
but Teo was much smarter
than you in school.

723
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:16,638
I grant you that.
That's quite true.

724
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:18,672
He still is, even now.

725
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:21,036
You like being with us, Teo?

726
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:25,676
Uncle, the sea's over there,
like a blue streak.

727
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:28,956
Dad, can I drive?

728
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:32,872
Come on, I'm just sitting here!
Let me drive!

729
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:36,630
That'd be the first time
a mule ever drove a horse!

730
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:41,832
That road is shorter.

731
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:43,951
That's an awful road,
full of potholes

732
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:46,236
big enough to swallow up
our carriage.

733
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:49,438
- Is something wrong?
- His pocket.

734
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,913
Why do you carry those
in your pocket?

735
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:01,633
These stones?

736
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:07,749
- Aren't they heavy?
- Stones are beautiful.

737
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:15,277
Stop the carriage.

738
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:18,990
- What is it?
- Teo needs to take a leak.

739
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:20,434
If he has to...

740
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:25,792
Watch your step getting down.

741
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:30,757
- You too?
- What of it?

742
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:33,276
Don't be long, Grandpa.
I'm hungry.

743
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:36,839
My father's father used to say,

744
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:40,550
“To be fit as a fiddle,
you have to piddle.

745
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:44,679
To be fit as a frog,
pee like a dog.”

746
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:46,797
What a beautiful green, Teo!

747
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:55,156
- Nice mare. How old is she?
- Three years and two months.

748
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:58,551
She's got just one bad habit:
She can't stand train whistles.

749
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:01,950
When I'm waiting
my turn at the station,

750
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:04,634
it's really a job to hold her!

751
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:07,912
- What'll you give her to eat today?
- S o m e cappel/e lii.

752
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:09,957
You forgot to unbutton your fly.

753
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:12,157
Uncle pissed in his pants!

754
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:16,958
And they said he was okay!

755
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:20,233
You didn't undo your fly.

756
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,560
He forgot.

757
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:28,635
It's true.
The sea looks like a blue streak.

758
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:30,393
Uncle, you pissed
in your pants!

759
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:32,153
Shut up!

760
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:34,436
He didn't open the shop!

761
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:38,352
No matter.
You can change at the farm.

762
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:45,673
Come here, or <i>I'll</i> throw myself
under the wheels!

763
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:48,830
Sit down, you little hoodlum!

764
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,718
Shall we move on?

765
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:51,995
Go, go!

766
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:04,716
Another fine meal.

767
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,957
You all go and see the spring.

768
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:10,720
My son Teo and I will stay here

769
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:12,393
and have another glass of wine.

770
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:15,712
Fine, but just one.

771
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:17,871
Know what I'm gonna do?

772
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:20,069
Take a nap.

773
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:24,269
Good. It'll be nice
here in the shade.

774
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:27,436
The egg's lovely, isn't it, Teo?

775
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,673
I'm like that too.

776
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:33,430
I can stare
at an egg for hours,

777
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:37,753
wondering how nature
can make things so perfect.

778
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:42,120
'Cause it was God who made nature,
not an ignoramus like you!

779
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:44,590
On, lay off!

780
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:46,273
See you back here later.

781
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:48,198
Keep your eye on him, Dad.

782
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:51,074
Menghino,
how far away is this spring?

783
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:01,157
Uncle, look.
I'm hypnotizing it.

784
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:08,674
Oliva!

785
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:15,273
There's a toad here
that looks like Father Balosa.

786
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:25,636
- How is it?
- Fantastic.

787
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:29,759
And it won't give you a hangover.
We'll set this here.

788
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:38,238
Get that away from there!

789
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:40,318
Naughty boy!

790
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:47,118
I know your name,
you delinquent!

791
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:52,117
- Dad!
- What?

792
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:55,033
Uncle Teo's up a tree!

793
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:59,435
- What's he shouting?
- I didn't understand.

794
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:02,871
Uncle Teo's up a tree!

795
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:08,512
I want a woman!

796
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:14,600
I want a woman!

797
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:24,038
Where am I going
to find you a woman, my boy?

798
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:25,838
Your uncle's up there.

799
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:28,077
I want a woman!

800
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:30,671
He's up there!

801
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:36,198
Come down, Teo,
or you'll hurt yourself.

802
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:38,511
Go get a ladder!

803
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:42,754
Is this how you keep an eye on him?
How did he get up there?

804
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:44,558
I'll go up and get him.

805
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:47,878
I'm gonna pound you
into the ground!

806
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:50,429
I want a woman!

807
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:55,078
How did he get up there?
If he falls, he'll break his neck.

808
01:15:55,240 --> 01:15:58,995
- Go inside and stop being dramatic!
- Dramatic?

809
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:01,198
How did this happen?

810
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:05,399
We were having a drink,
and suddenly -

811
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:07,471
He climbed up there like a cat.

812
01:16:07,680 --> 01:16:10,433
Are you throwing stones
at your old dad?

813
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:12,034
Get down here!

814
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:13,918
That's enough now!

815
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:19,398
Aurelio, don't you go crazy
on me too!

816
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:22,200
Teo, you've upset your brother.

817
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:24,439
Come down now!

818
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:27,917
I want a woman!

819
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:33,075
Quite a normal urge, actually.
He's 42 years old.

820
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:34,759
Yeah, but he's gonna fall.

821
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:37,474
When I was 42...

822
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:40,919
I'm telling you.

823
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:42,400
That's enough now!

824
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:45,516
Come down, Teo!

825
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:55,676
Good shot, Uncle!
Right in the head!

826
01:16:56,840 --> 01:16:58,592
My head!

827
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:02,430
I'm coming up now.
Don't throw anything at me.

828
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:05,477
We'll take some birds home -

829
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:10,312
- You want to kill us all?
- I'm going up there.

830
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:12,519
Yes, sirree!

831
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:15,672
Throw one at me
and you'll hear about it!

832
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:20,154
What a shot!

833
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:24,598
Bastard! I hope somebody
kicks you in the nuts!

834
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:32,000
Christ, what'll I do now?
Jerk off?

835
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:38,831
I'm an asshole,
a stupid asshole!

836
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:43,837
We're all going home.

837
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,355
Driver, hitch up the horse.
We're going home.

838
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:49,478
Come on, everyone.
We're going home.

839
01:17:49,680 --> 01:17:54,197
- You just gonna leave him up there?
- Yes! Hitch up the horse.

840
01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:57,910
- Whatever you say.
- Dad! Titta!

841
01:17:58,120 --> 01:18:00,760
Get your mother.
Where's your mother?

842
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:03,514
- You're leaving him there?
- He's fine.

843
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:06,149
Let's go! I want to go home.
But he's my son!

844
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:07,435
Aurelio, listen.

845
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:10,274
I want a woman!

846
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:15,271
Teo, we're going. Come down!

847
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,196
- But he's sick!
- We're just pretending. Come on!

848
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:24,479
Aurelio, let me climb up.
<i>I'll</i> talk to him.

849
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:26,199
<i>I'll</i> get him down.

850
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:34,875
Everyone in the carriage!

851
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:38,313
We're leaving right now!
Get in!

852
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:41,874
Teo, you gonna stay up there?

853
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:44,236
We're going now. It's late.

854
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:48,236
It's getting dark.
Who'll take you back?

855
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:50,553
You gonna stay up there?

856
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:52,712
All right, then. Bye!

857
01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:03,512
Come down!

858
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:13,754
Teo, Holy Mother of God!
Are you gonna come down?

859
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:16,238
We're leaving!

860
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:17,720
Go!

861
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:21,596
- Teo, come down!
- Bye, Uncle!

862
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:45,589
He'll kill us all today.

863
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:51,478
Come on, everyone out!
No questions!

864
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:53,637
What are you crying about?

865
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:56,599
You drive to the hospital
and get the attendants.

866
01:19:56,760 --> 01:19:58,876
Hurry, or I'll throw myself
down the well!

867
01:20:00,240 --> 01:20:03,995
What are you crying about?
It's one big laugh riot!

868
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:24,120
Listen to the poor boy.

869
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:28,199
Feeling better?

870
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:36,156
I want a woman!

871
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:48,953
I can't stand any more!

872
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:52,278
- Make him shut up!
- Dad.

873
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:54,474
What do you want?

874
01:20:54,680 --> 01:20:56,591
Shall I go and get Volpina?

875
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,513
Dad, look!

876
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:08,359
Mamma, they're here.

877
01:21:11,080 --> 01:21:13,196
- Evening, Doctor.
- What's happened?

878
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:17,189
- He's up the tree.
- Nice place. Ls all this yours?

879
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:19,556
It's just an old farm.

880
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:24,112
He's been up there
for five hours.

881
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:26,476
You can't see him now
because of the foliage.

882
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:28,751
- What did you do to him?
- Nothing.

883
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:31,031
He's been shouting
and throwing stones.

884
01:21:31,240 --> 01:21:34,437
I hope he won't be like this
his whole life.

885
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:36,716
A dwarf nun!

886
01:21:40,360 --> 01:21:42,670
It'll be bad for him
and worse for us.

887
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:44,751
Don't worry.
She'll take care of it.

888
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:47,956
Been getting some fresh air?

889
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:51,758
Is she going UP?

890
01:21:53,160 --> 01:21:57,199
Come down now! I'm not going
to play these damn silly games!

891
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:04,199
Jesus, look at that!
She got him right down!

892
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:09,591
She got him down,
and he's all happy.

893
01:22:15,240 --> 01:22:16,799
Here he is.

894
01:22:17,320 --> 01:22:20,756
Up to your tricks again,
were you?

895
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:23,317
What were you doing up there?

896
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:26,319
Counting how many stones
fig trees grow this season.

897
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:29,353
Go on now. Take him home.

898
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:34,955
Some days he's normal, some days not.
Just like the rest of us.

899
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:39,118
- Bye, Uncle.
- Titta, take care.

900
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:47,029
You can see Gigino's place
from up there.

901
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:50,035
I haven't seen him in so long.

902
01:22:54,760 --> 01:22:58,640
Between 11:00 and midnight,
in Caghetta's boat.

903
01:22:59,960 --> 01:23:03,430
It's 30 stories high,
with 16 smokestacks.

904
01:23:04,160 --> 01:23:07,152
Think what a pirate could do
with a ship like that.

905
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:38,829
Where's Ronald Colman?
I don't see him.

906
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,435
Hurray for Gradisca!

907
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:45,352
<i>Hello, sister.</i>

908
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:49,673
Your steamboat. Climb aboard.

909
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:57,238
Where are all these people going?

910
01:23:57,800 --> 01:24:01,316
Where are they going
with hearts pounding?

911
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:07,839
Today is a very important day
for our country, for the fatherland.

912
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,913
Come on, we're off!

913
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:13,071
If you drop me, you'll pay.

914
01:24:13,240 --> 01:24:16,358
I'd like to tell you but I can't,

915
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:20,991
because it's all still up in the air.

916
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:25,717
Where are all these people going?
Stop busting their balls.

917
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:41,830
How far out will it be?

918
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:45,834
Four miles. But thanks to Galileo,
it will seem like 400 feet to us.

919
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:49,152
Marvelous! <i>It'll</i> seem like
it's coming straight at us.

920
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:09,758
Mr. Lawyer,
how much will it weigh?

921
01:25:10,520 --> 01:25:12,750
About 21/2 times
the weight of the Grand Hotel.

922
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:15,156
Plus the Arch of Augustus.

923
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:19,917
<i>Go thou, Queen of the Sea</i>

924
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:22,720
“Thou passeth, and thy destiny

925
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:25,679
I shall follow in the waves,

926
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:29,390
watching your glistening wake.”

927
01:25:30,440 --> 01:25:34,559
Move closer to your mother.
Ma'am, move nearer to your son.

928
01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:39,918
Holy shit!
That water's really freezing!

929
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:44,600
My nuts have shriveled
to the size of two dried beans.

930
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:48,832
- You swam all the way from the shore?
- Where else?

931
01:25:50,120 --> 01:25:51,599
Freestyle.

932
01:25:55,520 --> 01:26:00,833
<i>I want to dance with you.</i>

933
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:06,114
<i>Like this all night.</i>

934
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:11,111
The third day, I went out in my little boat
and whistled as usual.

935
01:26:12,360 --> 01:26:15,432
Up jumps the dolphin
near the edge of the boat.

936
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:18,035
He looks at me
and says, “Mamma.”

937
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:19,713
What a load of bull!

938
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:23,510
No, dolphins are intelligent.
My dentist told me so.

939
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:29,400
Look how many there are.

940
01:26:29,560 --> 01:26:33,076
Millions and millions
and millions of stars.

941
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:34,878
Jesus Christ!

942
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:39,153
I wonder how they all
stay in place up there.

943
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:43,871
I mean,
it's pretty simple for us.

944
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:47,192
To build a house,
we use so many bricks, so much lime.

945
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:51,319
But up there, sweet Jesus!
Where do you put the foundations?

946
01:26:51,480 --> 01:26:53,949
They're not made of confetti,
you know.

947
01:26:54,120 --> 01:26:55,349
Miranda.

948
01:26:55,720 --> 01:26:58,439
Are you asleep? Answer me.

949
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:01,992
Are you cold? Take my jacket.

950
01:27:02,160 --> 01:27:03,719
I don't want it.

951
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:07,396
Put it around your shoulders
or you'll start complaining of a chill.

952
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:10,154
Have we got
much longer to wait?

953
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:12,630
How would I know?
They said around midnight.

954
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:15,076
But it's coming
all the way from America!

955
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:19,236
Go fuck yourselves, all of you!

956
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:21,118
Some friend, eh?

957
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:27,551
That's his way of being nice.

958
01:27:29,080 --> 01:27:34,234
I was full of hope every time,
but it never came to anything.

959
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:37,033
And now...

960
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:40,235
You know how old I am?
Fiftytwo?

961
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:42,636
I'm not ashamed
to tell the truth.

962
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:46,589
In fact, I always add on
a few years. I'm 30.

963
01:27:46,760 --> 01:27:49,320
- Hard to believe.
- I haven't given up hope.

964
01:27:49,480 --> 01:27:51,869
I thought 27 or 28.

965
01:27:52,040 --> 01:27:57,319
I want one of those encounters
that last a lifetime.

966
01:27:58,440 --> 01:28:01,239
I want a family, children,

967
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:07,271
a husband to chat with
in the evening over coffee, maybe,

968
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:11,434
and to make love with now and then,
because when you must, you must.

969
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:15,038
But affection is
even more important than love,

970
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:18,672
and I'm so full of affection.

971
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:22,153
But who can I give it to?
Who will take it?

972
01:28:22,320 --> 01:28:24,470
Why are you crying?

973
01:28:24,640 --> 01:28:26,631
The silly girl's crying.

974
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:31,192
Because she's a delicate
and sensitive girl.

975
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:33,192
Don't cry. I'm here.

976
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:37,797
- She's right. Men are all the same.
- Don't cry, my darling.

977
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:02,554
There it is!

978
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:04,154
Dad!

979
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:07,597
<i>The Hex!</i>

980
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:13,156
Hurray for the Rex!
The greatest thing the regime ever built!

981
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:20,110
As the representative of the Podesté,
I wish you a safe journey!

982
01:29:20,280 --> 01:29:22,510
Long live Italy!

983
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:24,639
What's it like?

984
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:13,751
<i>Gina!</i>

985
01:30:16,440 --> 01:30:18,238
Just look at this.

986
01:30:26,840 --> 01:30:29,195
Can't see a darned thing.

987
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:34,309
<i>I'll</i> keep to the wall.

988
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:39,276
The last fog like this was in '22.

989
01:30:44,680 --> 01:30:48,355
Careful now! Stop!
There's a man here!

990
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:55,509
Well, damn it all!

991
01:30:58,840 --> 01:31:00,433
Gina!

992
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:09,511
Where am I?

993
01:31:10,440 --> 01:31:12,431
I don't seem to be anywhere.

994
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:19,476
If death is like this,

995
01:31:20,360 --> 01:31:22,476
I don't think much of it.

996
01:31:24,120 --> 01:31:25,997
Everything's gone:

997
01:31:26,160 --> 01:31:30,791
People, trees, birds, wine.

998
01:31:33,320 --> 01:31:35,118
Well, up yours!

999
01:31:42,200 --> 01:31:43,838
Dino!

1000
01:31:45,320 --> 01:31:48,438
I can't even find my house.
Where am I?

1001
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:53,079
What do you mean?
You're right in front of it!

1002
01:32:05,680 --> 01:32:09,719
- Where are you going in this fog?
- To school. Bye, Grandpa.

1003
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:12,713
Just think of that.

1004
01:33:31,240 --> 01:33:32,958
<i>I was in Norway.</i>

1005
01:33:33,480 --> 01:33:35,153
Two women.

1006
01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:38,637
Beautiful, huge

1007
01:33:38,840 --> 01:33:40,274
Norwegians!

1008
01:33:40,440 --> 01:33:42,033
Beans, olives,
toasted melon seeds!

1009
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:55,074
It's open. You can get in.

1010
01:33:55,640 --> 01:33:57,870
Last one in is a queer!

1011
01:33:58,320 --> 01:34:01,551
Naso, get an eyeful of this.

1012
01:34:13,480 --> 01:34:14,800
Look at that!

1013
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:17,319
IFS gorgeous!

1014
01:35:16,640 --> 01:35:18,836
Where are you, my love?

1015
01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:16,671
- It was No. 18.
- Campari!

1016
01:36:16,840 --> 01:36:18,877
Aldina, wanna know who it was?

1017
01:36:19,360 --> 01:36:21,158
We know. It was Campari.

1018
01:36:21,320 --> 01:36:23,880
I met him in the race at Monza.

1019
01:37:51,440 --> 01:37:55,115
- Lallo, where are you going?
- Be careful!

1020
01:37:56,280 --> 01:37:58,954
- What is it?
- An ear.

1021
01:37:59,440 --> 01:38:01,113
Look, an ear!

1022
01:38:17,920 --> 01:38:20,230
- May I come in?
- I'm closed.

1023
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:23,392
May I come in, miss?
Good evening.

1024
01:38:23,560 --> 01:38:26,074
- What do you want?
- A cigarette.

1025
01:38:30,920 --> 01:38:34,072
- May I help you?
- You couldn't manage.

1026
01:38:34,240 --> 01:38:36,072
What do you mean?

1027
01:38:36,240 --> 01:38:39,631
I can lift 175 pounds.
I can even lift my father.

1028
01:38:39,800 --> 01:38:41,757
Don't make me laugh.

1029
01:38:42,400 --> 01:38:46,234
- Why? What do you weigh?
- I don't know.

1030
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:50,511
- I could lift you too.
- Oh, yeah?

1031
01:39:09,320 --> 01:39:11,118
Let's see.

1032
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:13,669
I really can, you know.

1033
01:39:13,880 --> 01:39:15,234
Let's see.

1034
01:39:20,640 --> 01:39:24,270
Silly boy, put me down!

1035
01:39:25,200 --> 01:39:27,157
- I did it!
- You're very strong.

1036
01:39:27,320 --> 01:39:28,640
See?

1037
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:31,952
I can do it again.
I don't believe you.

1038
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:39,797
That's enough now.

1039
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:43,397
Put me down.

1040
01:39:47,800 --> 01:39:51,236
- You drive me -
- I said that's enough.

1041
01:39:51,960 --> 01:39:56,318
What are you doing?
You'll drop me, you crazy boy!

1042
01:39:58,840 --> 01:40:00,751
You're crazy, you know that?

1043
01:40:01,360 --> 01:40:04,398
What's happening to me?
Oh, my head.

1044
01:40:04,600 --> 01:40:08,389
See how many times I did it?

1045
01:40:13,520 --> 01:40:16,831
Yes, my little darling.

1046
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:21,233
Come here.
You really are sweet.

1047
01:40:22,520 --> 01:40:27,276
Drive me crazy... just a little.

1048
01:40:27,440 --> 01:40:29,829
- What should I do?
- Suck.

1049
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:32,680
Come on.

1050
01:40:37,960 --> 01:40:40,236
You can have this one too.

1051
01:40:40,840 --> 01:40:43,753
Don't blow! Suck!

1052
01:40:43,920 --> 01:40:46,116
Is this right?

1053
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:53,269
You have to suck, you idiot!

1054
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:55,875
What are you doing?
I can't breathe!

1055
01:40:56,880 --> 01:40:58,632
Stop it now.

1056
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:01,236
Go on now. I have to close up.

1057
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:05,518
What was it you wanted?
A cigarette?

1058
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:08,912
It's on me. Now scram.

1059
01:41:16,920 --> 01:41:19,480
- I can't lift it.
- Out of the way.

1060
01:41:22,320 --> 01:41:25,233
- Go on. Get out.
- Good night.

1061
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:35,076
Drink it. It'll do you good.

1062
01:41:35,440 --> 01:41:38,319
- It's hot!
- It's supposed to be.

1063
01:41:55,760 --> 01:41:57,319
There's a fly in here.

1064
01:41:57,480 --> 01:42:00,836
- Where?
- There.

1065
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:02,513
It was there.

1066
01:42:04,040 --> 01:42:07,112
The only house
with flies in the winter.

1067
01:42:09,440 --> 01:42:11,750
How did it happen
with you and Dad?

1068
01:42:11,920 --> 01:42:13,718
How did what happen?

1069
01:42:13,880 --> 01:42:18,636
How'd you meet,
fall in love, get married?

1070
01:42:21,280 --> 01:42:23,669
What's all this about?

1071
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:25,877
And who remembers anyway?

1072
01:42:26,040 --> 01:42:29,396
Your dad's not a great one
for compliments.

1073
01:42:29,560 --> 01:42:32,632
He was a laborer at Saludecio.

1074
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:37,795
My folks had a bit of money
and didn't think much of him.

1075
01:42:38,840 --> 01:42:41,878
So... well...

1076
01:42:43,080 --> 01:42:47,836
we eloped
without a word to anyone.

1077
01:42:48,480 --> 01:42:51,313
When did he give you
the first kiss?

1078
01:42:51,880 --> 01:42:54,554
What kind of question is that?

1079
01:42:55,800 --> 01:42:58,792
I don't even know
if there was one.

1080
01:42:59,520 --> 01:43:03,753
The first time we met,
he raised his hat, and that was all.

1081
01:43:04,440 --> 01:43:07,034
It was the most
one could do in those days.

1082
01:43:07,360 --> 01:43:12,514
It's not like now,
when all kinds of things go on.

1083
01:43:12,680 --> 01:43:14,671
But I never manage
to do anything!

1084
01:43:14,840 --> 01:43:16,990
Keep those covers on.
You're all sweaty.

1085
01:43:17,160 --> 01:43:19,993
What do you mean “manage”?
You're still in short pants.

1086
01:43:20,160 --> 01:43:24,199
Get me some long ones then,
like the other kids!

1087
01:43:24,360 --> 01:43:26,351
What others?

1088
01:43:27,560 --> 01:43:31,190
She told me I wasn't to send
any more love letters.

1089
01:43:31,520 --> 01:43:34,831
Take the bike and get the doctor.
Tell him to hurry.

1090
01:43:35,320 --> 01:43:38,153
Get him to examine you too.
You scared me the other day.

1091
01:43:38,320 --> 01:43:39,833
Run along.

1092
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:47,271
But <i>I'll</i> send letters
whenever I like.

1093
01:43:51,280 --> 01:43:52,759
Africa.

1094
01:43:52,920 --> 01:43:55,150
I'll become a doctor
and go to Africa.

1095
01:43:55,320 --> 01:43:57,709
That'll teach her.

1096
01:44:10,960 --> 01:44:13,236
<i>It's snowing outside!</i>

1097
01:44:23,440 --> 01:44:25,351
It's true! It's snowing!

1098
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:30,196
Professor Fighetta, up yours!

1099
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:33,997
If it goes on like this,
there'll be no school for days.

1100
01:44:34,200 --> 01:44:36,953
Look, the mountains are all white!

1101
01:44:37,160 --> 01:44:39,993
Let's go see the snow
on the water.

1102
01:44:40,160 --> 01:44:42,436
Too moist. <i>It'll</i> never stick.

1103
01:44:52,040 --> 01:44:54,919
Go away.
Get the hell out of here.

1104
01:45:19,800 --> 01:45:21,438
Stay where you are.

1105
01:45:21,800 --> 01:45:22,949
The sparrows!

1106
01:45:48,200 --> 01:45:50,999
- Wait, I'm coming with you.
- Hurry up.

1107
01:46:04,560 --> 01:46:07,120
Titta, look how it's coming down!

1108
01:46:10,760 --> 01:46:12,558
Let's open the window.

1109
01:46:13,600 --> 01:46:15,273
It's beautiful!

1110
01:46:19,560 --> 01:46:20,834
Me too!

1111
01:46:25,280 --> 01:46:26,873
Still snowing!

1112
01:46:27,040 --> 01:46:30,670
Four days this goddamn stuff's
been around!

1113
01:46:38,880 --> 01:46:41,793
This will go down
as the Year of the Big Snow.

1114
01:46:41,960 --> 01:46:44,554
With the exception
of the Ice Age,

1115
01:46:45,240 --> 01:46:50,076
it's never snowed
this heavily in our town.

1116
01:46:53,800 --> 01:46:57,509
That must've been some young boy,
not the usual guy.

1117
01:46:57,720 --> 01:47:00,997
As I was saying,
the exceptional years were

1118
01:47:01,160 --> 01:47:04,391
1541, 1694,

1119
01:47:04,600 --> 01:47:07,956
1728 and 1888,

1120
01:47:08,120 --> 01:47:12,910
when, against all odds,
it snowed on July 13th.

1121
01:47:39,440 --> 01:47:41,636
You'll make us all deaf, idiot!

1122
01:47:59,440 --> 01:48:01,158
Where is she?

1123
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:11,479
How's your mother?

1124
01:48:13,160 --> 01:48:14,719
Better now.

1125
01:48:15,560 --> 01:48:18,712
She's still in the hospital,
but she's off the critical list.

1126
01:48:18,880 --> 01:48:24,319
That's good - the poor woman.
Give her my regards.

1127
01:48:24,480 --> 01:48:26,596
Your mother's a kind lady.

1128
01:48:26,760 --> 01:48:31,391
She always gave me
soup and wine.

1129
01:48:31,880 --> 01:48:33,518
A kind lady.

1130
01:49:09,080 --> 01:49:10,753
How are you feeling?

1131
01:49:11,960 --> 01:49:15,191
I brought you carnations.
Thank you. How are you?

1132
01:49:16,440 --> 01:49:18,033
Hello, Aurelio.

1133
01:49:18,680 --> 01:49:20,432
They're lovely.

1134
01:49:20,720 --> 01:49:24,350
I was just looking out the window.
Now I'll go back to bed.

1135
01:49:24,720 --> 01:49:26,836
But I'm feeling better today.

1136
01:49:27,160 --> 01:49:28,958
What lovely colors.

1137
01:49:29,360 --> 01:49:31,670
Aren't you hot with this on?

1138
01:49:32,120 --> 01:49:34,999
- Have you eaten?
- Yes.

1139
01:49:51,480 --> 01:49:53,915
Are you still getting
on your father's nerves?

1140
01:49:54,080 --> 01:49:56,594
He pounds me over the head!

1141
01:49:57,040 --> 01:49:59,554
He'll beat all the sense out of me!

1142
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:13,276
They have a nice garden here.
I didn't know.

1143
01:50:14,040 --> 01:50:16,236
It looks as though it's in bloom,
with the snow.

1144
01:50:16,400 --> 01:50:18,710
Mamma, it's still snowing.

1145
01:50:20,720 --> 01:50:23,553
In one sense,
you're lucky to be here,

1146
01:50:23,760 --> 01:50:26,513
all warm in bed,
with this weather.

1147
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:32,589
The poor man's tired
when he gets home.

1148
01:50:32,760 --> 01:50:35,593
Don't talk back to him.
You're a grown-up now.

1149
01:50:38,280 --> 01:50:41,910
Don't throw ice! It hurts!

1150
01:50:45,880 --> 01:50:50,158
“Wind and rain, go home again.
I don't want to feel the pain.”

1151
01:50:50,480 --> 01:50:52,630
Idiot! No!

1152
01:50:59,400 --> 01:51:01,152
A difficult shot, Your Excellency!

1153
01:51:11,480 --> 01:51:13,517
No! Not at Gradisca!

1154
01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:20,996
Enough! <i>I</i> give up!

1155
01:51:24,640 --> 01:51:28,679
Break my windows
and I'll crack your skulls open!

1156
01:51:33,080 --> 01:51:34,434
Who's that?

1157
01:51:41,440 --> 01:51:43,317
- What's that?
- I don't know.

1158
01:51:51,120 --> 01:51:53,794
Look, it's the count's peacock!

1159
01:51:56,760 --> 01:51:58,478
There it is.

1160
01:51:58,840 --> 01:52:00,513
It's coming down.

1161
01:52:08,680 --> 01:52:10,751
Shall we catch it, boys?

1162
01:52:17,880 --> 01:52:19,075
Holy shit!

1163
01:52:26,760 --> 01:52:29,593
<i>I don't understand.
What's happened?</i>

1164
01:52:29,800 --> 01:52:32,394
<i>I'll tell you in the car, Uncle.</i>

1165
01:52:32,720 --> 01:52:35,633
Why in the car?
Where are we going?

1166
01:52:35,800 --> 01:52:39,077
Close by. To Aunt Zaira's farm.

1167
01:52:39,240 --> 01:52:42,517
A relative's come from America
and wants to say hello to you.

1168
01:52:42,960 --> 01:52:46,590
Then why doesn't he come here?

1169
01:52:46,760 --> 01:52:48,751
Who is this relative?

1170
01:53:16,200 --> 01:53:17,554
Auntie died.

1171
01:53:24,720 --> 01:53:26,916
Be strong.

1172
01:53:35,480 --> 01:53:38,438
Don't take it like that.
Open up.

1173
01:53:40,680 --> 01:53:43,718
- Open up.
- No, I won't!

1174
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,276
- Lallo!
- He fainted!

1175
01:54:11,880 --> 01:54:14,394
Uncle's not feeling good.

1176
01:54:17,840 --> 01:54:19,831
Then take him
to the whorehouse.

1177
01:54:24,560 --> 01:54:26,995
Make the sign of the cross, Dad.

1178
01:54:49,240 --> 01:54:51,516
- How do you feel now?
- Better.

1179
01:54:54,640 --> 01:54:57,473
Don't take it so hard.
Be strong.

1180
01:55:25,680 --> 01:55:28,718
Everybody in line now.
Where are the orphans?

1181
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:39,159
Stop that!

1182
01:58:12,760 --> 01:58:15,036
Hurray for the bride and groom!

1183
01:58:17,760 --> 01:58:19,592
Give me your arm, Naso.

1184
01:58:20,200 --> 01:58:24,751
Make way, make way!
My breasts are full of milk!

1185
01:58:26,440 --> 01:58:32,436
“'Bride and groom' or 'newlyweds, '
whatever they may call ya,

1186
01:58:33,055 --> 01:58:35,415
here's hoping you find wedded bliss
in far-off Battipaglia.”

1187
01:58:35,440 --> 01:58:38,717
When you're drunk,
you can even rhyme!

1188
01:58:42,960 --> 01:58:46,510
<i>Gradisca's getting married
and going away.</i>

1189
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:53,119
Sorry if we got on your nerves.
We hate to see you go.

1190
01:58:56,600 --> 01:58:58,876
We're really going to miss you!

1191
01:59:03,400 --> 01:59:05,835
“Silence is golden,
but words are like jewels.

1192
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:09,470
May this married couple
live happy as fools!”.

1193
01:59:09,640 --> 01:59:11,153
Where's the bride?

1194
01:59:11,960 --> 01:59:17,160
Our Gradisca is leaving us.
She found her Gary Cooper.

1195
01:59:17,320 --> 01:59:20,836
Though Gary Cooper's a cowboy,
while Matteo is a carabiniere.

1196
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:24,834
But love is love all the same.
Good luck, Gradisca.

1197
01:59:25,640 --> 01:59:27,916
Long live the bride and groom!

1198
01:59:28,080 --> 01:59:31,471
You have fulfilled
your dream of love.

1199
01:59:31,680 --> 01:59:35,913
Now it's your happy duty
to have many children

1200
01:59:36,080 --> 01:59:40,631
for your family, for the church
and for your country!

1201
01:59:42,800 --> 01:59:47,351
“Gathered here at the drinking trough,
here's one more toast to send them off!”.

1202
01:59:49,800 --> 01:59:52,269
A picture!

1203
01:59:52,440 --> 01:59:55,000
We're gonna take pictures now.

1204
01:59:55,160 --> 01:59:57,834
Give me your mirror.

1205
01:59:58,040 --> 02:00:00,793
Everybody get behind the bride.

1206
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,196
She's lovely, our Ninola!

1207
02:00:03,360 --> 02:00:06,318
Why are you crying?
I'm not crying anymore.

1208
02:00:06,480 --> 02:00:07,959
Get closer together.

1209
02:00:08,120 --> 02:00:10,555
The carabiniere
should move back a little.

1210
02:00:11,720 --> 02:00:13,358
Stand in the light.

1211
02:00:13,920 --> 02:00:17,072
- Hold it.
- Hey, it's raining.

1212
02:00:17,240 --> 02:00:19,880
Smile.

1213
02:00:20,560 --> 02:00:21,550
One more.

1214
02:00:21,880 --> 02:00:24,156
Gangway!

1215
02:00:24,360 --> 02:00:27,273
Stop falling all over us,
you drunkard!

1216
02:00:29,240 --> 02:00:34,758
Let's move into the sun,
with the bride in the center.

1217
02:00:41,480 --> 02:00:45,314
I've made up another rhyme,
and it goes like this:

1218
02:00:45,480 --> 02:00:48,632
“Though the world may be full
of things beautiful and dear,

1219
02:00:49,080 --> 02:00:52,436
of towns even nicer
and prettier than here -”.

1220
02:00:52,640 --> 02:00:56,076
A little water'll do you good.
You'll have a bath for once.

1221
02:00:56,400 --> 02:00:57,799
Get up.

1222
02:00:58,760 --> 02:01:03,436
It stopped. Sit down and play!

1223
02:01:04,040 --> 02:01:06,873
A wet bride is a lucky bride.

1224
02:01:11,760 --> 02:01:14,274
Long live Italy!

1225
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:27,358
How will you live
so far from here?

1226
02:01:28,320 --> 02:01:31,199
Good-bye to you all. Go home.

1227
02:01:32,920 --> 02:01:34,831
Biscein bids you good-bye.

1228
02:01:45,520 --> 02:01:48,239
Naso, I'm going home!

1229
02:01:50,120 --> 02:01:53,431
Wait for me!
I'm coming with you!

1230
02:02:17,160 --> 02:02:19,310
Wait! My bouquet!

1231
02:02:19,880 --> 02:02:23,236
Good-bye! I love you all!

1232
02:02:25,960 --> 02:02:27,917
Gradisca's taking off!

1233
02:02:28,480 --> 02:02:29,800
She's leaving.

1234
02:02:29,960 --> 02:02:32,918
Good-bye, Gradisca!

1235
02:03:03,840 --> 02:03:05,797
The puffballs!

1236
02:03:11,920 --> 02:03:13,672
<i>'Fitted.!</i>

1237
02:03:15,400 --> 02:03:17,550
Where's Titta?

1238
02:03:17,720 --> 02:03:20,234
Shall we go fishing
in the harbor?

1239
02:03:22,920 --> 02:03:26,276
Titta left a while ago.

1238
02:03:27,720 --> 02:03:50,234
